# rasterized-pdfs-poc

This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) website that takes in PDF files, rasterizes
them in the browser and then saves them again as PDFs. This is useful, e.g., for
compressing PDFs with lots of vector handwriting.

Do not expect support or continued development, this is a one-off project.
